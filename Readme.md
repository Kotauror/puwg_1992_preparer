# A support tool for the churchy project.

The purpose of using it is transforming coordinates as presented in the Polish e-mapa services, that is [PUGW 1992 aka EPSG:2081](https://gis-support.pl/baza-wiedzy-2/podstawy-gis/uklady-wspolrzednych-w-praktyce/) to the WSG84 format that's used on Google Maps.

### How to use it

1. Get the PUGW 1992 coordinates. I was getting them from https://polska.e-mapa.net/ as per instructions below
